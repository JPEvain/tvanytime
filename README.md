TV-Anytime maintenance repository

TV-Anytime is an ETSI specification that was first published in 2003.

The purpose of TV-Anytime is to provide a common data format for the publication of TV programmes 
using traditional broadcasting or on-demand services. 
TV-Anytime is a solution to describe programmes, schedules, services, schedules and catalogs.

TV-Anytime was a precursor in proposing solutions for personalisation and recommendations.
For that reason, TV-Anytime also describes users and usage.

The TV-Anytime specification has also been adopted and adapted for Radio.

For the past 10+ years, with one maintenance phase every 12 to 18 months,
the maintenance of TV-Anytime has mainly focused on part 3-1 of the specification.
